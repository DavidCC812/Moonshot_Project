## Progress Summary
</div>

- The mobile application’s frontend was fully refined:
  - A new **color palette** was implemented for visual cohesion.
  - A **progress bar** was added to the login and itinerary flows for better feedback and navigation.
  - A **card-based UI system** was introduced for itinerary items to improve clarity and structure.
  - Redundant or unnecessary screens were removed, resulting in a **streamlined user experience**.
  - The result is a clean, complete, and modern-looking first version of the frontend.

- Backend planning and setup were initiated:
  - **Java with Spring Boot** was chosen as the primary backend framework.
  - **PostgreSQL** was selected as the database.
  - **Docker** was introduced to containerize the application for easier development and deployment.
  - Tooling included **IntelliJ** for backend development and **DBeaver** for database visualization.
  - The backend was initialized using **Spring Initializr**, following industry-standard project setup.

## Conclusion
</div>

March marked a turning point for the Inclusive Trip Planner, with the frontend reaching a visually and functionally complete state. Simultaneously, the project’s backend infrastructure was strategically planned and initialized, setting the stage for API development in April. The project is now ready to transition into full-stack development.
