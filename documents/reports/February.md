- Implement the initial structure and navigation across all major screens.
- Choose and configure the development tools and frameworks.
- Begin learning and applying Kotlin Compose to UI development.

## Progress Summary

</div>

- The development environment was successfully set up using **Android Studio**.
- **Kotlin Compose** was selected as the main frontend framework for building the user interface.
- Rather than using traditional design tools like Figma, UI mockups were implemented directly in code to streamline the process.
- A **functional first draft** of the frontend was completed:
  - Most major screens were built in a basic state.
  - The main navigation flow (login, itinerary creation, accessibility ratings) was established.
  - The entire app workflow could be followed end-to-end, albeit with simple UI.

## Challenges Encountered

</div>

- The main challenge was the **learning curve of Kotlin Compose**, which was unfamiliar at the start of the month.
- Additionally, **limited design experience** made UI styling and visual refinement more difficult.
- However, prior experience with **Java** helped ease the transition to Kotlin thanks to their similar syntax and structure.

## Key Goals for Next Month

</div>

- **Refine and finalize** the user interface and app flow based on the initial draft.
- Improve layout consistency, accessibility, and visual presentation across all screens.
- Begin planning the backend structure, including technology choices and basic architecture.
- Define how the frontend will interact with backend services in the future.

## Conclusion

</div>

February focused on laying the groundwork for the Inclusive Trip Planner’s mobile interface. The basic structure of the application is now functional, with all key workflows mapped out. Despite some technical and design challenges, strong progress was made using Kotlin Compose, and the project is well-positioned for refinement and feature integration in March.
